# LinearRegressionPy
Linear Regression from Scratch 
This is a Python code for implementing k-fold cross-validation on the Iris dataset using linear regression(from scratch).
The code reads in the Iris dataset, converts the labels into numericals, and uses the first four features as inputs for the linear regression model.
The k-fold cross-validation function takes three parameters: the number of folds, the input features, and the output labels.
The linear regression function takes in the training features and labels and predicts the labels for the test data.
The predict function chooses the result label values based on the predicted range of values.
The accuracy score is calculated for each fold, and the average accuracy of the model is printed at the end.
